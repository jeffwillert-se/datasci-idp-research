  Your job is to return charges found in the invoice. \
  Charges are the prices associated with the determinants or are associated with \
  account fees, surcharges, taxes, and other charges.

  It is very important that each and every LINE ITEM charge is captured, but \
  do not capture any subtotals or totals.  Those will be captured separately.

  We also need to capture the commodity type for each charge.  Sometimes, charges \
  will be associated with a meter number.  If so, you should include the meter \
  number in the JSON.  If not, you should return "N/A" as the meter number. If \
  a charge is associated with all meters or all commodities, you should return \
  "ACCOUNT" as the meter number.

  Finally, make sure you capture the currency type for each charge.

  It is very important to capture charges, even if the amount is $0.00.  It's possible \
  that in some scenarios, the taxes are broken out separately from the charges, but they \
  MUST be captured, regardless.  The only caveat is that occasionally, the taxes are \
  are "included" in other charges.  In this case, do not capture the taxes, as that \
  may lead to double counting.  The line items which are already included in other charges \
  are usually denoted like "State Utility Tax ($123.45 included in above charges)". If you do \
  not see this phrase, then you can assume that the taxes are not included in other charges.
  
  Each charge MUST include these exact field names (case-sensitive):
  - "name": Charge description (string)
  - "amount": Numeric value (number)
  - "category": One of ["Usage", "Demand", "Fixed", "Tax"] (string)
  - "commodity": Type of utility service (string, e.g. "Electric Power", "Natural Gas")
  
  Optional fields:
  - "determinant_name": Name of associated determinant (string or null)
  - "meter_number": Associated meter number or "ACCOUNT" (string)
  - "currency": Currency code (string, default "USD")
  
  IMPORTANT: 
  1. Return a JSON array of objects, even for a single charge
  2. Use exactly these field names with exact case matching
  3. Do not copy the example below - extract actual charges from the invoice
  4. If there are charges associated with specific periods of time, don't use exact dates, just label them "Sample Charge - PERIOD 1", "Sample Charge - PERIOD 2", ...

  Example structure (DO NOT COPY THESE VALUES):
  [
    {
      "name": "Basic Charge",
      "amount": 25.95,
      "category": "Fixed",
      "commodity": "Electric Power",
      "determinant_name": null,
      "meter_number": "P171644707",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "name": "Demand Charge - PERIOD 1",
      "amount": 412.34,
      "category": "Demand",
      "commodity": "Electric Power",
      "determinant_name": "Demand"",
      "meter_number": "P171644707",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    {
      "name": "Demand Charge - PERIOD 2",
      "amount": 146.31,
      "category": "Demand",
      "commodity": "Electric Power",
      "determinant_name": "Demand"",
      "meter_number": "P171644707",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]

  Don't forget to capture charges, even if the dollar amount is $0.00.
