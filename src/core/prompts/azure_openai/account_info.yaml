 Your job is to return account information found in the invoice. \
 Usually, all of the relevant account information can be found on the first page. \

 The fields you should explicitly return are: - "account_number": Customer account identifier (string)
  - "invoice_number": Invoice identifier (string)
  - "invoice_date": Invoice date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - "billing_period_start": Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - "billing_period_end": End date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - "vendor_name": Utility company name (string)
  - "customer_name": Account holder name (string)
  - "service_address": Service location (string)
  - "meter_numbers": Array of meter numbers (array of strings)
  - "subtotals": Dictionary of commodity subtotals ({"commodity": number})
  - "total_amount": Total invoice amount (number)
  - "commodities": Array of utility types (e.g. ["Electric Power", "Natural Gas"])

  IMPORTANT: 
  1. Return response in JSON format with exact field names (case-sensitive)
  2. All dates MUST be in YYYY-MM-DD format
  3. All numeric values must be numbers, not strings
  4. Return null for any missing optional fields

  Example response:
  {
    "account_number": "123456789",
    "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "invoice_date": "2024-03-01",
    "billing_period_start": "2024-02-01",
    "billing_period_end": "2024-02-29",
    "vendor_name": "Pacific Power & Light",
    "customer_name": "John Smith",
    "service_address": "123 Main St, Portland, OR 97201",
    "meter_numbers": ["P171644707"],
    "subtotals": {"Electric Power": 1234.56},
    "total_amount": 1234.56,
    "commodities": ["Electric Power"]
  } 

  It's possible that not all of the fields are present on the invoice, but \
  you should always return the data in the JSON format. For missing fields, \
  you should return "N/A" as the value.
