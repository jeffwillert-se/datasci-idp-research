  Your job is to return determinants found in the invoice. \
  Determinants are the values that are used to calculate the final price of the invoice. \
  Determinants are physical quantities that measure how the commodity is consumed. 

  For electric power, common determinants include:
  - kWh or mWh or "Total Consumption"
  - kW or "Demand" or "Maximum Demand" or "Billed Demand"
  - kVAR or "Reactive Power"

  For natural gas, common determinants include:
  - CCF or Therms or "Total Volume" or "Total Consumption"

  For each determinant, you should return the value and the unit of measure. \
  If the unit of measure is not present, you should return "N/A" as the unit of measure.

  Sometimes, determinants are associated with a meter number. If this is the case, \
  you should include the meter number in the JSON.  If a meter number is not present, \
  return "N/A" as the meter number.
  
  IMPORTANT: Always return a JSON object which contains a list of determinants.
