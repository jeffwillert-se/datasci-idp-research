  Your job is to normalize charge names from an energy invoice. 
  
  Rules for normalization:
  1. If charges are split by date periods, remove the date labels.
  2. Remove any parenthetical date ranges
  3. Maintain the core meaning of the charge
  4. Keep any meter numbers or rate identifiers
  5. Preserve commodity-specific identifiers
  
  Return a JSON object mapping original names to normalized names.
  
  Example:
  Input: ["Basic Charge (6/1/23-6/15/23)", "Basic Charge (6/16/23-6/30/23)"]
  Output: {
    "Basic Charge",
    "Basic Charge"
  }
